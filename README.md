A Rails vaporware API to handle back-end transactions for a "smart lease" iOS app, built in a few hours during the Lighthouse Labs 2017 Alumni Hackathon. If you use your imagination, you can picture transactions being made to Ethereum contracts, storing tenant-landlord interactions in the block chain.
